Hello World
Review

In this lesson, we accomplished a lot of things! We instructed our computers to print messages, we stored these messages
as variables, and we learned to update those messages depending on the part of the program we were in. We performed
mathematical calculations and explored some of the mathematical expressions that Python offers us. We learned about
errors and other valuable skills that will continue to serve us as we develop our programming skills.

Good job!

last exercise :
Create variables:

    my_age
    half_my_age
    greeting
    name
    greeting_with_name

Assign values to each using your knowledge of division and concatenation!

my code :
"""
my_age = 51
half_my_age = my_age/2
greeting = "Hello World"
name = "Lucas"
greeting_with_name = print(greeting + name)
"""
